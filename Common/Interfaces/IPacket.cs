        //Could probably use the same api the Socket.Send Ilist is using but with different pointers in the list which correspond to the correct data.
        //MemorySegment is exactly like ArraySegment anyway,
        //Therefore, I Could probably unsafely change the type of the reference to ArraySegment<byte> and it would probably work in place...

        //Mono - Xamarin
        //Supports send with ArraySegment but also has a Send_nochecks and Send_internal / Xamarin may not implement.
        //It may be easier to just stub a method for sending (and recieving) rather than trying to act differently depending on the RunTime but the RunTimes are different to a degree.

        //Microsoft -
        //BufferOffsetSize is used in 4.6 http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/net/System/Net/Sockets/Socket.cs
        //DoMultipleSend, BeginMultipleSend, EndMultipleSend
        //MultipleConnect
        //This could call those methods with the MemorySegment especially if MemorySegment was able to used as a BufferOffsetSize structure.

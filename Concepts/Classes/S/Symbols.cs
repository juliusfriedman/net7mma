    #region Syllogism

    /*
     
    A syllogism (Greek: συλλογισμός syllogismos, "conclusion, inference") is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true.

    In its earliest form, defined by Aristotle, from the combination of a general statement (the major premise) and a specific statement (the minor premise), a conclusion is deduced. For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise) and that Socrates is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal. Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form (without sentence-terminating periods):[citation needed]

    All men are mortal

    Socrates is a man

    Therefore Socrates is mortal
     
     * 
     *  `semideum`, for the punishment was related to that of `killing a god`؟ -

    //See also, Theophrastus of Eresus,

    /*
     
     Prosleptic syllogisms are classified in three figures, or potential arrangements of the terms according to the figure of the prosleptic proposition used. First figure: “A is universally predicated of everything that is universally predicated of G” Second figure: “Everything predicated universally of A is predicated universally of G” Third figure: “A is universally predicated of everything of which G is universally predicated”

     Consequently, a third figure prosleptic syllogism would read “A is universally affirmed of everything of which G is universally affirmed; G is universally affirmed of B; therefore, A is universally affirmed of B.” ("All G are A; all B are G; therefore, all B are A" or "Statement A is always true of everything for which statement G is always true; statement G is true of all things B; therefore, statement A is true of all things B.")

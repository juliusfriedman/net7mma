        A Session / Conference can be created to faciliate the reporting process and keep track of last active senders / receivers if required

        E.g. it will have a source table use the above algorithms and may be abstract or provide only a partial implementation
        
        Rtcp Scheduling should be implemented in the conference level see => http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550#appendix-A.7
         
        It is up to the conference to handle SDP Announcement for new members and changes in the conference.

            'sink' is used exactly 3 times in the same paragraph, additionaly it is bound by no definition given prior.

            Besides the one I am sure we are all familiar with a `sink` may also define a one-way channel of data transfer but which way? 
         * It probably SHOULD be out, but could be in as well.. but that would be a source now wouldn't it?
         * 
         * E.g. Does a `Sink` emit data, data which can be put into the sink from anywhere including another sink?
         * 
         * E.g. a `Source` must only receive data then...

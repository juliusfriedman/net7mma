                 4.2.1. ES_ID Signaling through the RTP Header
                In a similar manner with the FlexMux tools [14]
                (codeMux mode), we transmit in the RTP packet header a
                code value that indicates the RTP payload organization. In
                such a way to make a correspondence between each
                ES_ID and its associated reduced SL packet, which is
                carried in the RTP payload. This code field may be
                mapped into the SSRC RTP header field (see Figure 4).
                Nevertheless, this approach induces additional out of band
                signaling of the correspondence tables between the
                codeMux field and the associated ES_IDs.
                In addition, the dynamic behavior of MPEG-4 scene
                (e.g. apparition of a new ESs during the MPEG-4 session)
                induces a continuous signaling of the correspondence
                tables, which are exposed to loss. This will result in a
                multiplexing blocking, then a decoding blocking.

                 AU Headers Length: is a two bytes field that specifies:
                    The length in bits of the concatenated AU-headers. If the
                    concatenated AU-headers consume a non-integer number
                    of bytes, up to 7 zero-padding bits must be inserted at the
                    end (PAD field) in order to achieve byte-alignment of the
                    AU Header Section.

                    [SL Packets Only (Draft)] ES_ID: is a two bytes field that specifies the ES_ID
                    associated to the AUs carried in the reduced SL packet.
                    This field is common to all the AUs encapsulated into the
                    SL packet. This minimizes the overhead. The ES_ID field
                    is the only one that must be present in the SL packet
                    header.
                    For each Access Unit in the SL packet, there is exactly
                    one AU-header. Hence, the nth AU-header refers to the
                    nth AU.

                     * 
                    AU Size: indicates the size in bytes of the associated
                    Access Unit in the reduced SL payload.
                    Index / IndexDelta: indicates the serial number of the
                    associated Access Unit (fragment). For each (in time)
                    consecutive AU or AU fragment, the serial number is
                    incremented with 1. The AU-Index-delta field is an
                    unsigned integer that specifies the serial number of the
                    associated AU as the difference with respect to the serial
                    number of the previous Access Unit. The Index field
                    appears only on the first AU Header of the reduced SL
                    packet.
                     * 
                    CTS-Flag: Indicates whether the CTS-delta field is
                    present. A value of 1 indicates that the field is present, a
                    value of 0 that it is not present.
                     * 
                    CTS-Delta: Encodes the CTS by specifying the value of
                    CTS as a 2's complement offset (delta) from the
                    timestamp in the RTP header of this RTP packet. The CTS
                    must use the same clock rate as the time stamp in the RTP
                    header.
                     * 
                    DTS-Flag: Indicates whether the DTS-delta field is
                    present. A value of 1 indicates that the field is present, a
                    value of 0 that it is not present.
                     * 
                    DTS-Delta: specifies the value of the DTS as a 2's

                    DTS must use the same clock rate as the time stamp in the
